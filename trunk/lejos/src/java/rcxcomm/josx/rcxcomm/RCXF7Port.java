/** RCXF7Port provides an interface similar to java.net.Socket
 * Adapted from original code created by the LEGO3 Team at DTU-IAU
 * This version of RCXPort uses Serial comms, not low-level comms.
 * Serial comms uses the RCX Rom routines which only support Lego
 * firmware opcodes and protocol. The F7 (set message) opcode is used
 * as it allows comms in both direction. This protocol is the same as
 * that used by RCXPort in lejos 1.0.5, although the implementation is 
 * slightly different. This protocol is not very suitable for java streams.
 * Bytes can get lost, and they can be delivered more than once. The
 * protocol supported by RCXPort is far better as in provides guaranteed
 * delivery of all data and is much faster. This version is provided for
 * compatibiltity with the lejos 1.0.5 protocol, and possible interaction
 * with Lego firmware programs (such as nqc programs). A two level protocol
 * stack is used consisting of F7DeliveryHanler (which does Acks, and retries) 
 * and F7Handler.
