The Makefile for the irtower dll or shared library needs to access the
JNI include files (jni.h and an OS dependant one) from your JDK 
installation. This requires the JDK environment variable to be set
to the directory that your JDK is installed in. The jni.h include file
is in $JDK/include and the OS dependant one is $JDK/include/win32 or
$JDK/include/genunix.
