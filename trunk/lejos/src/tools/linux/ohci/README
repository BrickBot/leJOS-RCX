This directory contains a patch for OHCI USB for the lego USB tower. If you build
modules for your kernel, you can patch /usr/src/linux with this patch and then rebuild
and reinstall the modules. If you don't, you can get the usb-ohci.c and usb-ohci.h
files and move them into this directory to build them locally with the provided
Makefile.

If you haven't built the kernel before, it is probably worth just buying a PCI USB 
card which supports UHCI - it is a whole lot easier.
