legousbtower version 0.53

legousbtower is a kernel usb driver which allows communication with the Lego RCX 2.0 brick. 
It is distributed as part of the LeJOS project <http://www.lejos.org>

NOTE for users with USB ports that use OHCI (you can tell by doing an lsmod and seeing if
usb-ohci is loaded as a module). There is a bug in OHCI which prevents the tower from working.
See the README in the tools/linux/ohci directory for details of an available patch.

* Installation

type: make

If you have any problems, it is likely to be with the location of your kernel include files. Normally,
the Makefile will try and use the the include files in the build directory in /lib/modules - otherwise
it will use /usr/src/linux/include.

As root, type: make install

NOTE: this won't install the module into the modules directory. You can do this manually and 
edit your rc scripts to automatically load the module at boot time.
