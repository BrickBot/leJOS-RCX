This directory contains the code necessary to create the Unix emulation tool.
The code for this tool is split into two parts. There is the virtual machine
code itself, and that can be found in ../vmsrc. This directory contains only
that necessary to create the emulator, emu-lejosrun.

This lists the main files the unix_impl directory. 

dump_config.c		This tests for endian type (ie little or big endian)
			and creates the file platform_config.h.
dump_config		Run this and it generates the platform_config.h
			file. This is the executable generated from
			dump_config.c
tvmemul.c		Main entry point for Tiny VM emulation.
dump.c			This dumps the contents of the Tiny VM binary.
			Synopsis:
				dump <path> [class|constant] <index>
			This is a diagnostic tool used for development. An
			example of its usage is this:

				dump Test.class class LCD

platform_config.h	This is used in all the builds in this directory.
nativeemul.c		Native method handling for unix emulation
			implementation.
load.c			Loads the VM binary into memory. This involves opening
			and reading the file, followed by a test of its magic
			number to make sure it is an RCX binary file. (MAGIC is
			defined in ../vmsrc/magic.h to be 0xCAF1.) 
load.h			Header file for load.c
opcodeinfo.c		Machine-generated file of opcodes. These match the
			opcodes listed in the Java VM spec. For more info
			about these see:

				http://java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec

systime.h		System header file.
traceemul.c		Defines the assert function.
documentation.c		Routines that are called when the -v switch i used.
