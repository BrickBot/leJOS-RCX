	<h1>What is leJOS?</h1>
	leJOS (pronounced like the Spanish word "lejos" for "far") is a tiny (~ 16 Kb) Java-based operating system that has been ported to the following platforms:
	<ul>
		<li>Lego Mindstorms RCX, i.e. Hitachi H8300</li>
		<li>Unix (for emulation of RCX programs only)</li>
	</ul>
	leJOS has been forked out of the <a href="http://tinyvm.sourceforge.net">TinyVM project</a>. 
	<br>it contains a VM for Java bytecodes and additional software to load and run Java programs. 
	These are some of the features offered:
	<ul>
		<li>Object oriented language (Java)</li>
		<li>Preemptive threads (tasks)</li>
		<li>Arrays, including multi-dimensional ones</li>
		<li>Recursion</li>
		<li>Synchronization</li>
		<li>Exceptions</li>
		<li>Well-documented API</li>
	</ul>
	The features above are also provided by TinyVM. But in addition to these, leJOS also offers
	<ul>
		<li>A Windows version, which doesn't require CygWin</li>
		<li>A MacOSX version</li>
		<li>Floating point operations (doubles truncated to 32 bits)</li>
		<li>String constants</li>
		<li>Casting of longs to ints and vice versa</li>
		<li>Marks references in the stack (which makes it feasible to implement garbage collection)</li>
		<li>Multi-program downloading</li>
		<li>java.lang.Math class with sin, cos, tan, atan, pow, etc.</li>
		<li>Additional APIs</li>
	</ul>
	TinyVM is still around simply as a low-footprint alternative to leJOS. TinyVM is about 7 Kb smaller in the RCX.
	
	<h1>Preliminaries</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>You need a Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.4 or above</li>
		<li>Your PATH must contain the JDK's bin directory</li>
		<li>Make sure you have set JAVA_HOME properly to the root directory of the JDK</li>
		<li>For the vision parts, you need a Java Media Framework (JMF) 2.1 or above (will be brought along by the leJOS distribution)</li>
		<li>In case you want to build the distribution, your PATH must contain the ant binary (ant 1.6 or above)</li>
		<li>Add leJOS's bin directory to your PATH</li>
		<li>Set RCXTTY to your 'tower' device (e.g. COM1 or usb)</li>
		<li>Download firmware using firmdl</li>
		<li>Compile using lejosc instead of javac</li>
		<li>Downaod programs in the RCX using lejoslink and lejosdl</li> 
		<li>Run programs in the host using emu-lejos</li>
		<li>Exceptions: Use lejosdl -verbose. Exceptions are shown in the RCX as [XXXX Y], where XXXX = method_signature and Y = exception_class_index MOD 10</li>
   	</ul>

	<h1>Installation and Set Up</h1>
	Please download the leJOS documentation from the same location you downloaded this distribution from
	and consult the "First Steps" section of the <a href="http://lejos.sourceforge.net/tutorial/index.html">
	Tutorial</a> contained there. 
	<ol>
		<li>Set your environment variable <em>LEJOS_HOME</em> to the directory you installed this distribution into</li>
		<li>Set your environment variable <em>RCXTTY</em> to <em>usb</em> (for USB towers) or <em>COM1</em> (for serial towers)</li>
 	</ol>
 	Check the installation by switching to the "check" folder of the lEJOS distribution and run 
 	<ol>
 		<li>compileDistributionCheck.bat resp. compileDistributionCheck.sh</li>
 		<li>linkDistributionCheck.bat resp. linkDistributionCheck.sh</li>
 		<li>downloadDistributionCheck.bat resp. downloadDistributionCheck.sh (please switch on RCX before)</li>
 	</ol>
  	A very simple test program will be downloaded to the RCX. After the download has finished, press the RCX's 'RUN' button.
  	The RCX's LCD should print the strings "SMOKE" and "TEST".

	<h1>Known limitations</h1>
	Due to size constraints, some Java language features have been omitted. Others just haven't been 
	implemented yet. Known limitations are:
	<ul>
		<li>Garbage collection is not performed yet. Hence, the number of objects in your program should be limited</li>
		<li>Switch statements are not supported</li>
		<li>Arithmetic operations on variables of type long are not supported, although you can cast ints to longs and vice versa</li>
		<li>Maximum array length is 511</li>
		<li>The instanceof operation will always be true for interfaces. In bytecode, CHECKCAST succeeds on all interface classes (which is a bit unsafe)</li>
		<li>The instanceof and checkcast operations are rejected by the linker when they are performed on array classes (e.g. b instanceof byte[])</li>
		<li>There are no objects of type java.lang.Class, which means that the ".class" construct won't work.
		Class.forName() throws ClassNotFoundException at all times.
		As a consequence, reflection is not supported by leJOS</li>
		<li>Most JDK APIs are unavailable</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h1>Known Bugs</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>MONITOREXIT ignores null objects (it assumes MONITORENTER has handled them). Furthermore, it doesn't check monitor validity. Until this bug 
    		is fixed (actually, at all times) all monitors should be constants</li>
		<li>Initializers (static or otherwise) are not implicitly synchronized. This could lead to access of statics before they are initialized, when
    		multiple threads use a class</li>
    </ul>
    
	<h1>Documentation</h1>
	Please download the leJOS documentation from the same location you downloaded this distribution from.
	The documentation contains the API docs and the tutorial.
	Online versions may be retrieved from <a href="http://lejos.sourceforge.net/">http://lejos.sourceforge.net/</a>.

	<h1>License</h1>
	We are releasing under the Mozilla Public License (see the LICENSE file) for now, since Kekoa Proudfoot's librcx is under that same 
	license, and leJOS is linked against -lrcx and -lfloat, which are part of librcx. No changes have been made to those libraries, 
	so they haven't been redistributed. They are only needed if you are planning to modify the native C source code. See docs/hacking.
