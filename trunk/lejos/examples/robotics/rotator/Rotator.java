/**
 * DESCRIPTION
 *   Program that makes PATHFINDER learn to rotate
 *   by simply using a light sensor to scan normally
 *   diverse surroundings.
 *
 * CAUTION
 *   The wheels of your robot may fall off after
 *   several rotations.
 *
 * REQUIREMENS
 *   - A simple robot that can rotate, with a 
 *     configuration equivalent to the "PATHFINDER"
 *     (RIS Constructopedia, page 6). You may want
 *     to try different wheel sizes and surfaces 
 *     to check that the program really works.
 *   - A light sensor connected to sensor input 2.
 *     The light sensor should be pointing in a direction
 *     parallel to the floor.
 *   - You may need to change the SAMPLINGS and MOTOR_POWER
 *     constants below. I tried my experiments on
 *     carpet. For smooth surfaces, I suspect you'd
 *     have to set SAMPLINGS to 1, and MOTOR_POWER to 1. 
 *     The idea is that the robot should perform test 
 *     rotations between 2 * 360 and 4 * 360 degrees. Anything 
 *     outside of that range could produce erroneous results.
 *     In other words, the second and fourth
 *     flashing numbers you see should be between
 *     2000 and 4000.
 *
 * HOW TO RUN
 *   - You should read $TINYVM_HOME/README if you
 *     still haven't.
 *   - Set TINYVMPATH     : export TINYVMPATH=.
 *   - Compile the program: tvmc Rotator.java
 *   - Link the class     : tvmld Rotator -o Rotator.tvm
 *   - Download TinyVM firmware if necessary.
 *   - Make sure the robot is about 3 feet away from anything
 *     else. Make the sorroundings somewhat varied. I use
 *     a flashlight, but it looks like this isn't really
 *     necessary. Don't move too much.
 *   - Run linked binary  : tvm Rotator.tvm.
 *     The download time is about 30 seconds.
 * 
 * WHAT IT DOES
 *   - Performs one rotation of more than 720 degrees.
 *     The robot starts to scan its sorroundings with
 *     the light sensor (hopefully) only after the
 *     motors have achieved constant speed. Does
 *     some analysis for a few seconds.
 *   - Performs another rotation, but in 5 steps.
 *     Scans basically all the way through.
 *   - Analyzes the data obtained in the two trial runs,
 *     and determines the constant motor velocity,
 *     and the startup delay factor.
 *   - Makes the robot move in a straight line,
 *     turn 180 degrees, and move in the opposite
 *     direction. It repeats this 4 times.
 *     The error for a 180 degrees rotation is
 *     probably about 5% to 10%, on carpet.
 *
 * NOTES
 *   Send me email at jhsolorz@yahoo.com if you find
 *   ways to make the rotation analysis more precise.
