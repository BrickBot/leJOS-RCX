This example can be used to demonstrate the reliability of the
RCXPort LLC default protocol. It uses the same RCX program -
SensorReader - as the sensor_reader example. The PC program
ReadSensor communicates with ReadSensor to request 20 sensor readings.
Move the IR tower in and out of view of the RCX and you will send how
communication starts again with no data loss when the tower comes
back into view.
