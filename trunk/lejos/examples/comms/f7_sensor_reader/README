To run do

If necessary prepare tower
% setenv RCXTTY ...

If necessary download firmware

Compile and load program on RCX
% make

Connect a sensor to sensor port 2 (best is touch sensor).

Start the program on the RCX.

Compile and run the host program
% make host_run

Watch the numbers change when you press the sensor.


Explanation:

The program on the RCX receives the number of the sensor to read
from the host as one byte and sends back the raw value in 0..1023
as a two-byte short.

Sensors are numbered 0..2, so the 1 sent corresponds to sensor port 2.

Communication is via RCXF7Port, which uses the standard F7 message format
of the LEGO firmware to provide byte streams.
