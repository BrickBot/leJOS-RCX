Prerequisites:
- Java distribution installed (1.3 or higher) and contained in your PATH
- leJOS distribution installed (http://sourceforge.net/projects/lejos - most recent cvs version preferred)
- leJOSUnit distribution installed (http://sourceforge.net/projects/lejosunit)
- ANT installed (at least version 1.5) and contained in your PATH

Configuration:
- Edit the build.properties file according to your settings
- Make sure that your CLASSPATH contains the entry "." (present folder)

Running Tests in emulation mode (completely on your machine, no Tower or RCX required):
- Switch to the folder containing this file 
- Run "ant runInEmulator" 

Running tests on RCX:
- Switch to the folder containing this file 
- Run "ant downloadToRCX" or just "ant" ("downloadToRCX" task is the build.xml file's default task) to download tests to the RCX
- When download is complete, hit "Run" on your RCX
- For interpretation of the displayed test results, please consult leJOSUnit's tutorial (cf. http://lejosunit.sourceforge.net/). 

Adding your own tests:
- Enhance josx.test.lejosunit.AllTests contained in the src folder by adding your test suite(s) to the "suite()" method
- Write the associated test suite(s) (for how to do so, cf. http://lejosunit.sourceforge.net)

TroubleShooting:
- If you encounter linking problems, a prior call to "ant clean" might be helpful.
