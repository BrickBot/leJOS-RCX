To run this example, edit Browser.java and change "page" to the web page 
you want to display.

Then compile and run Browser.java:

lejosc Browser.java
lejos Browser

Add pcrcxcomm.jar to the CLASSPATH and run josx.rcxcomm.SocketProxy 

E.g. on Windows:

set CLASSPATH=..\..\..\lib\pcrcxcomm.jar;.
java josx.rcxcomm.SocketProxy

Then, run the RCX program.

It will send the Web Site required to SocketProxy, and do an http get
on the page. SocketProxy shows the stream of bytes going out from the RCX
and going back in to the RCX.

When the http headers have been skipped, the RCX will start scrolling 
through the Web page a character at a time and displaying on the RCX LCD.

All text in tags including comments and scripts, is displayed.
