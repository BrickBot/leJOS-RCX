To run the servlet examples, make sure that your CLASSPATH contains pcrcxcomm.jar,
and your library path contains the irtower shared library. On Linux/Unix, do
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LEJOSHOME/bin.

Run the HttpProxy by:

java josx.rcxcomm.HttpProxy -port <port>

Compile and run the RCX servlets, e.g.

lejosc SensorServlet.java
lejos SensorServlet

Start a Web Browser and send a command to the RCX. E.g. if you ran the proxy
on port 8080, type in the following URL:

http://localhost:8080/activiate?Sensor=S2

and after about 10 seconds, A Web page will be displayed saying:

S2: activated

See the documentation at the start of the examples to see what other commands 
you can send them.
