# leJOS RCX
A tiny Java Virtual Machine for the Lego MindStorms RCX, containing a VM for Java bytecodes and additional software to load and run Java programs.

## IDE Configurations
* Eclipse:  Plugins available at the [leJOS-RCX-Eclipse](https://github.com/BrickBot/leJOS-RCX-Eclipse) project site
* Netbeans: [Archived _Makezine_ article](https://web.archive.org/web/20100117085123/http://www.makezine.com/extras/64.html)

## Alternate API
* [leJOS-RCX-Alt-API](https://github.com/BrickBot/leJOS-RCX-Alt-API):  An alternative to part of the standard leJOS API designed to fit an objects-early approach to teaching programming
  - Perhaps could be incorporated into the mainstream leJOS-RCX release at some point?

## Utilities
* [leJOS-RCX-MindStormsTools](https://github.com/BrickBot/leJOS-RCX-MindStormsTools)
  - A small toolkit to aid in the uploading of Java programs to LEGO MindStorms RCX bricks, providing functionality of the leJOS library in the development environment for this purpose
* [leJOS-RCX-Tools](https://github.com/BrickBot/leJOS-RCX-Tools)
  - A visual interface for leJOS. RCXDownload automatically sets the JDK-, leJOS- and ClassPaths, compiles the chosen Java-Source, shows the compiler messages and is able to link and load both the compiled classes and the leJOS-firmware.
* [leJOS-RCX-TextLCDApplet](https://github.com/BrickBot/leJOS-RCX-TextLCDApplet)
  - Java Applet GUI for testing josx.platform.rcx.TextLCD
