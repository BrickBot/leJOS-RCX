Possible bugs:

- computational overload from light sensor in flickering light?
- stack overflow on thread dying from exception?
- try off by one, catches exception just preceeding the try block?

Wishlist:

- see what happens in hardware reserved memory space
- disable internal memory to gain 512 bytes
- untangle Button, Sensor and Serial w.r.t. LISTENER_THREAD
- introduce constants.db for common contants
- let make fail with error if magic.h is older
  than common/classes.db or signatures.db or common/magic.db
- garbage collection
- relocation on load to run faster?
- other code mangling by linker
- new sensor code for slow counting (how?)
- implement lookupswitch/tableswitch vm instruction (as option)?
