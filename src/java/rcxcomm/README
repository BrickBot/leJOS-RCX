josx.rcxcomm is a package for communication between a PC or Mac and the RCX.

It is based on original code created by the LEGO3 Team at DTU-IAU.

It uses standard Java IO Streams to send primitive Java data types from the 
PC to the RCX, or from the RCX to the PC. Either end can initiate communication,
and data can be sent in both directions.

A simple program to send a byte is:

import josx.rcxcomm.*;
import java.io.*;

class TestRCXComm {

  public static void main(String [] args) {

    try {
      RCXPort port = new RCXPort();

      OutputStream os = port.getOutputStream();

      os.write(123);
      os.flush();
    }
    catch (IOException ioe) {
     ...
    } 
}

To read a byte back you would add:

      InputStream is = port.getInputStream();
   
      is.read();

To send other Java primitive types, such as int, you add:

   DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(os);

      dos.writeInt(123456);
      dos.flush();

Not all data types are available in the RCX implementation of 
DataInputStream and DataOutputStream. Object streams and 
serialization are not yet supported.

There are example programs in the rcxcomm/examples directory.

Both serial and USB towers are supported on Windows. Currently
only serial towers are supported for Linux and Mac OS X.

To compile the RCX program, you use lejosc. An extra jar 
(rcxrcxcomm.jar) is used automatically.

On the PC or Mac you compile with javac and add pcrcxcomm.jar 
from the lejos lib directory to your CLASSPATH.

The serial or USB tower is accessed by a dynamically linked library 
using the Java Native Interface (JNI). On Windows this is irtower.dll
and needs to be on you path. As it is in the lejos bin directory, it
will normally already be on your PATH. On Linux or Mac OSX, it is a
shared library, irtower.so, which needs to be on your shared library 
path. This can be achieved by adding the lejos bin directory to 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

The port used for the IR Tower can be set in two ways:

  - You can set RCXTTY and call RCXPort with no parameter
  - You can pass the port name on the RCXPort constructor.

For USB the port name is "USB", for a serial tower it is "COM1", "COM2" etc.

There is an extra class available for the PC and Mac - RCXBean. This 
provides a Java Bean interface for sending and receiving data from the RCX.
It is useful for creating Web sites using Java Server Pages (JSPs) that 
access the RCX to read sensors, perform actions, etc.

The protocol used by josx.rcxcomm is rather slow, and is not suitable for
sending large amounts of data.
