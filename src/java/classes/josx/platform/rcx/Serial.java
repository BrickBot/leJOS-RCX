/**
 * Low-level API for infra-red (IR) communication between
 * an RCX and the IR tower or between two RCXs.
 * For protocol details, Kekoa Proudfoot's Opcode Reference
 * is highly recommended. See Kekoa's 
 * <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/~kekoa/rcx/index.html">RCX Internals</a> page.
 * Kekoa Proudfoot has also written a C based tool
 * (<a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/~kekoa/rcx/tools.html">Send</a>)
 * which you can use to send packets to the RCX. If you prefer
 * to write everything in Java, you should become familiar with the
 * <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm/">Java Communications API</a>.
 * Frameworks based on this API have already been developed
 * by Dario Laverde 
 * (see <a href="http://www.escape.com/~dario/java/rcx/">RCXLoader</a>)
 * and Scott Lewis (see <a href="http://www.slewis.com/rcxport/">RCXPort</a>).
 * The Java Communications API is officially supported on Windows and Solaris.
 * <p>
 * Examples that use the leJOS Serial class can be found in:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>examples/serial</code> --- Receiver for certain opcodes, such as MotorOn.
 * <li><code>examples/serial2rcx</code> --- Communication between two RCXs.  
 * <li><code>examples/remotectl</code> --- Receiver for Lego remote control.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The basic pattern for a Receiver is:
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * <pre>
 *    byte[] packet = new byte[8];
 *    for (;;)
 *    {
 *      if (Serial.isPacketAvailable())
 *      {
 *        Serial.readPacket (packet);
 *        byte opcode = packet[0];
 *        if (opcode == AN_OPCODE)
 *          ...
 *          ...
 *        // Possibly send a response here
 *        packet = ~packet[0];
 *        Serial.sendPacket (packet, 0, PACKET_LENGTH);
 *      }
 *    }
 * </pre>
 * </code>
