* Installation

type: make

If you have any problems, it is likely to be with the location of your kernel include files. If you have not installed the kernel source, use /usr/include instead of the build includes which are the default.

As root, type: make install

NOTE: this won't install the module into the modules directory. You can do this manually and edit your rc scripts to automatically load the module at boot time.
