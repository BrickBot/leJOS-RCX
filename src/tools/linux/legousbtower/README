legousbtower version 0.53

legousbtower is a kernel usb driver which allows communication with the Lego RCX 2.0 brick. 
It is distributed as part of the LeJOS project <http://www.lejos.org>

* Installation

type: make

If you have any problems, it is likely to be with the location of your kernel include files. Normally,
the Makefile will try and use the the include files in the build directory in /lib/modules - otherwise
it will use /usr/src/linux/include.

As root, type: make install

NOTE: this won't install the module into the modules directory. You can do this manually and 
edit your rc scripts to automatically load the module at boot time.
