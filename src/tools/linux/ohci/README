This directory contains a patch for OHCI USB for the lego USB tower. If you build
modules for your kernel, you can patch /usr/src/linux with this patch and then rebuild
and reinstall the modules. If you don't, you can get the usb-ohci.c and usb-ohci.h
files and move them into this directory to build them locally with the provided
Makefile.

To do this:
[1] cp the files usb-ochi.c and usb-ohci.h into this directory from 
/usr/src/linux/drivers/usb/
[2] patch the file with the command:
patch -l -p0 < usb-ohci.patch
(Note that if this fails for any reason, you can manually edit the file to add the 
changes).
[3] build the module using 'make'
(Note this Makefile was designed to work with Red Hat distributions and should work
with others but you may have to play with the paths to get it working on your machine).
[4] To test, 'rmmmod usb-ohci' and then 'insmod ./usb-ohci.o' as root
[5] If this works, you can move the usb-ohci.o file into the 
/lib/modules/your kernel version/kernel/drivers/usb directory.


An alternative is to buy a PCI USB card which supports UHCI.
