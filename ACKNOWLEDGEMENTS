---------------------------

- TinyVM is linked with Kekoa Proudfoot's rcx library
  from librcx.

- TinyVM sources include "rom.h" from Kekoa Proudfoot's
  librcx.

- Several files were copied from Kekoa's librcx, 
  and modified slightly.

- I've read Kekoa's RCX internals page, especially
  the ROM disassembly and the bytecode specification,
  without which I couldn't have written the code necessary
  to download Java programs into the RCX.

- Dave Baum's email dated 29 Aug 1998, with subject
  "RE: Lego Mindstorms Page," describing the packet
  format, was very helpful in understanding how
  RCX communication works.

- An article that appeared in Dr. Dobb's Journal a
  few months ago by Markus Noga about legOS, is what
  led me to purchase the RIS and later to write
  this firmware replacement program. (The name TinyVM
  probably came from a comment about his tiny OS).

- Needless to say, I've read some of the legOS
  files.

- I'd like to thank anyone else who has played
  a part in figuring out RCX internals.

- SPECIAL THANKS to my wife, Erika, for putting up 
  with me during the development of this project.
