Making leJOS work on other platforms
------------------------------------

This should not be too hard, as leJOS already runs in the
RCX and on top of a Unix system, two very different platforms.
Of course, leJOS is intended for use in devices with fairly
limited memories (32 Kb - 1 Mb).

Do post a message in the tinyvm-develop mailing list if you're
interested in porting leJOS to other platforms, just so you
can prevent yourself or others from unnecessarily duplicating
existing efforts.

Create a new directory, e.g. my_device_impl. Use
rcx_impl and unix_impl as examples. Every platform needs
to provide a platform_config.h file and implementations for
all methods defined in vmsrc/platform_hooks.h. You will
need a C cross-compiler for your platform. Only gcc has been
tested so far.

An important component of the porting effort is getting
a linked binary into the device. In the RCX, the firmware
must contain some logic (rcx_impl/main.c) that allows
a download tool (tools/tvm.c) to send the binary over an
IR link. In Unix, the linked binary is simply a file that 
is loaded into memory. In other cases, you might have to
make the binary part of a ROM file, which might require 
making extensions to the linker (jtools/js/tinyvm).
