Version 0.1.1 (latest):

  - Fixed PUTSTATIC bug. (Setting a static field
    in uninitialized class could produce subsequent
    erroneous behavior).

  - Fixed exceptions bug. (Very critical bug:
    exceptions were not pushed on the stack before
    they were caught).

  - Changed RCX API so that its style conforms
    a bit more with other Java APIs. Namely, 
    depracted routines in ROM, and split them up
    into LCD and Sound, which have more convenient
    APIs. Removed some ROM routines, which hopefully
    haven't been used too much yet. Class Native
    now contains native APIs. ROM contains certain
    unclassified APIs.

  - Added buttons API.

  - Improved the usability of the firmware a bit.
    Basically, you can now press the On/Off button
    to turn off the RCX and kill running programs.

  - To continue on exception "traces" you have to
    press On/Off instead of View.

  - TinyVM has been ported to JDK1.2. This required
    a couple of fixes under jtools.

  - Footprint: Test13 can create 4338 empty objects
    (17352 bytes of allocation space).
