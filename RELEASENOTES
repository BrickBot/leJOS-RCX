Version 1.0.0:
--------------

  - CompactVM is born out of TinyVM. Versions starting
    with 0 are TinyVM versions, whereas versions starting
    with 1 are CompactVM versions.

Version 0.1.3:
--------------

  - Found that the hello example did not compile in
    the last version. Fixed it.

  - Decided to make the firmware show battery power 
    whenever it enters program-download mode.

  - Fixed virtual method linker bug. (The linker was
    unable to find certain virtual methods in classfiles
    compiled with JDK1.2.x).

  - Apparently fixed On/Off bug. (The LCD is not cleared 
    by shutdown_buttons in some RCXs).

  - Got rid of TINYVM_HOME.

  - TINYVMPATH is no longer necessary. CLASSPATH is
    used.

  - More appropriate message for linker failure when
    instanceof or checkcast of array classes is 
    encountered.

  - Multi-dimensional array allocation was broken.
    Fixed it.

  - Fixed checkcast bug. (It was not allowing casts of
    null).

  - Footprint report:
    Test13 creates 4238 objects.
    Firmware download count: ~1020

Version 0.1.2:
--------------

  - Fixed serial comm bug. (If you tried to download
    a program to the RCX while another program was
    running, the transferred data could clobber 
    program memory. TinyVM is now shutting down
    serial communications right after a program is
    downloaded).

  - Added a couple dummy classes to satisfy the
    jikes compiler. Users simply have to set JAVAC
    to "jikes". (Jikes is a really fast Java compiler
    by IBM).

  - Changed implementation of Sensor.readSensorValue.
    Reading values from sensors should be more
    efficient now. (I might have to adjust the rotator
    example a bit).

  - Publicized the SensorListener interface and
    Sensor.addListener. It probably still needs to
    be optimized for performance.

  - Added examples to some classes in the API
    documentation.

  - Removed "queued" parameter from most methods in
    Sound. It really didn't make sense to have it 
    in some APIs. Hopefully that won't be much of a 
    problem for anyone.

  - Removed previously deprecated APIs from ROM.
    Again, sorry if this affects you.

  - Fixed MONITORENTER bug. (It was not throwing
    NPE on null monitors - it was crashing instead).

  - TinyVM's linker is now also a loader: The -d
    option will download the program to the RCX.

  - TinyVM's firmware is now listening for the 
    standard "Delete Firmware" opcode (0x65/0x6d).
    Consequently, Prgm-Run On/Off is no longer
    useful, so it has been removed.

  - tvmfirmdl doesn't need an argument now.

  - Added the Serial API and a corresponding example.

  - Footprint report:
    Test13 creates 4262 objects.
    The firmware download count is about 1000.    

Version 0.1.1:
--------------

  - Fixed PUTSTATIC bug. (Setting a static field
    in uninitialized class could produce subsequent
    erroneous behavior).

  - Fixed exceptions bug. (Very critical bug:
    exceptions were not pushed on the stack before
    they were caught).

  - Changed RCX API so that its style conforms
    a bit more with other Java APIs. Namely, 
    depracted routines in ROM, and split them up
    into LCD and Sound, which have more convenient
    APIs. Removed some ROM routines, which hopefully
    haven't been used too much yet. Class Native
    now contains native APIs. ROM contains certain
    unclassified APIs.

  - Added buttons API.

  - Improved the usability of the firmware a bit.
    Basically, you can now press the On/Off button
    to turn off the RCX and kill running programs.

  - To continue on exception "traces" you have to
    press On/Off instead of View.

  - TinyVM has been ported to JDK1.2. This required
    a couple of fixes under jtools.

  - Footprint: Test13 can create 4338 empty objects
    (17352 bytes of allocation space).
