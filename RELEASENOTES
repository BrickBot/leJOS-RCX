Version 0.1.1 (latest):

  - Fixed PUTSTATIC bug. (Setting a static field
    in uninitialized class could produce subsequent
    erroneous behavior).

  - Changed RCX API so that its style conforms
    a bit more with other Java APIs. Namely, 
    depracted routines in ROM, and split them up
    into LCD and Sound, which have more convenient
    APIs. Removed some ROM routines, which hopefully
    haven't been used too much yet. Class Native
    now contains native APIs. ROM contains certain
    unclassified APIs.

  - Added a few classes: LCD, Sound, MinLCD, MinSound,
    Button.
